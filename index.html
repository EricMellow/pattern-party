      <h5>Moby-Dick or, The Whale</h5>
      <hr>
      <p>“All men live enveloped in whale-lines. All are born with halters round their necks; but it is only when caught in the swift,
      sudden turn of death, that mortals realize the silent, subtle, ever-present perils of life. And if you be a philosopher,
      though seated in the whale-boat, you would not at heart feel one whit more of terror, than though seated before your evening
      fire with a poker, and not a harpoon, by your side.”</p>

      <p>“How did she end up here, like this? How could there have been so much - so many moments, so many people and things, so many

      <h5>Slaughterhouse-Five</h5>
      <hr>
      <p>“America is the wealthiest nation on Earth, but its people are mainly poor, and poor Americans are urged to hate themselves....
      It is in fact a crime for an American to be poor, even though America is a nation of poor. Every other nation has folk traditions
      of men who were poor but extremely wise and virtuous, and therefore more estimable than anyone with power and gold. No such
      tales are told by American poor. They mock themselves and glorify their betters.”</p>

      <h5>Walden</h5>
      <hr>
      <p>“However mean your life is, meet and live it; do not shun it and call it hard names. It is not so bad as you are. It looks
      poorest when you are richest. The fault-finder will find faults even in paradise. Love your life, poor as it is. You may
      perhaps have some pleasant, thrilling, glorious hours, even in a poorhouse. The setting sun is reflected from the windows
      of the almshouse as brightly as from the rich man’s abode; the snow melts before its doors as early in the spring.”</p>
